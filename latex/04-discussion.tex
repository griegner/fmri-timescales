\section{Discussion}

Limitations:

"The non-specific origins of the hemodynamic signal constitute aspecific challenge. The most proximate drivers of the hemodynamic signal are not neuronal, but metabolic in origin. The polarization and depolarization of cells that underpins neuronal activity generates metabolic demand that effects flow dynamics in the underlying vasculature. [13]. These dynamics in turn leave amagnetic contrast based on the relative concentration of para and di-magnetic oxy (Hb) and deoxy-hemoglobin (dHb) in areas of activated tissue [14, 15]. The most proximate neurophysiological correlates of BOLD are neural oscillations in the low γ range [16–20], though this relationship isweak and not universally observed [21, 22]. BOLD appears to be driven by metabolic demands related to peri-synaptic activity [23], rather than neuronal outputs of projection neurons. This rules out some neuronal related inferences that can be drawn from fMRI signals. Despite co-acquisition of hemodynamic and electrophysiological signals, it iswidely accepted that the neurophysiological drivers of the signal are multi-faceted. This “many-to-one” mapping from the putative origins of the signal to its observed properties means that fMRI data do not permit specific inferences about neuronal process [12]."

Future directions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item multivariate (vector autoregression)
    \item nonstationary series (autocorrelations that are time dependent)
    \item nonparametric regression
\end{itemize}
