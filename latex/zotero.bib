	abstract = {The dependence between pairs of time series is commonly quantiﬁed by Pearson's correlation. However, if the time series are themselves dependent (i.e. exhibit temporal autocorrelation), the effective degrees of freedom ({EDF}) are reduced, the standard error of the sample correlation coefﬁcient is biased, and Fisher's transformation fails to stabilise the variance. Since {fMRI} time series are notoriously autocorrelated, the issue of biased standard errors – before or after Fisher's transformation – becomes vital in individual-level analysis of resting-state functional connectivity ({rsFC}) and must be addressed anytime a standardised Z-score is computed. We ﬁnd that the severity of autocorrelation is highly dependent on spatial characteristics of brain regions, such as the size of regions of interest and the spatial location of those regions. We further show that the available {EDF} estimators make restrictive assumptions that are not supported by the data, resulting in biased {rsFC} inferences that lead to distorted topological descriptions of the connectome on the individual level. We propose a practical “{xDF}” method that accounts not only for distinct autocorrelation in each time series, but instantaneous and lagged crosscorrelation. We ﬁnd the {xDF} correction varies substantially over node pairs, indicating the limitations of global {EDF} corrections used previously. In addition to extensive synthetic and real data validations, we investigate the impact of this correction on {rsFC} measures in data from the Young Adult Human Connectome Project, showing that accounting for autocorrelation dramatically changes fundamental graph theoretical measures relative to no correction.},

How receptor systems are situated within macro-scale neuroanatomy and how they shape emergent function remain poorly understood, and there exists no comprehensive atlas of receptors. Here we collate positron emission tomography data from more than 1,200 healthy individuals to construct a whole-brain three-dimensional normative atlas of 19 receptors and transporters across nine different neurotransmitter systems. We found that receptor profiles align with structural connectivity and mediate function, including neurophysiological oscillatory dynamics and resting-state hemodynamic functional connectivity. Using the Neurosynth cognitive atlas, we uncovered a topographic gradient of overlapping receptor distributions that separates extrinsic and intrinsic psychological processes. Finally, we found both expected and novel associations between receptor distributions and cortical abnormality patterns across 13 disorders. We replicated all findings in an independently collected autoradiography dataset. This work demonstrates how chemoarchitecture shapes brain structure and function, providing a new direction for studying multi-scale brain organization.},

While theoretical accounts predict the emergence of a corresponding hierarchy of neuronal timescales, direct electrophysiological evidence across the human cortex is lacking. Here, we infer neuronal timescales from invasive intracranial recordings. Timescales increase along the principal sensorimotor-to-association axis across the entire human cortex, and scale with single-unit timescales within macaques. Cortex-wide transcriptomic analysis shows direct alignment between timescales and expression of excitation- and inhibition-related genes, as well as genes specific to voltage-gated transmembrane ion transporters. Finally, neuronal timescales are functionally dynamic: prefrontal cortex timescales expand during working memory maintenance and predict individual performance, while cortex-wide timescales compress with aging. Thus, neuronal timescales follow cytoarchitectonic gradients across the human cortex and are relevant for cognition in both short and long terms, bridging microcircuit physiology with macroscale dynamics and behavior.},

To explore this question, we examined resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-{fMRI}) data using complex topology measures from network neuroscience. Here we show that spatial and temporal autocorrelation are reliable statistics that explain numerous measures of network topology. Surrogate time series with subject-matched spatial and temporal autocorrelation capture nearly all reliable individual and regional variation in these topology measures. Network topology changes during aging are driven by spatial autocorrelation, and multiple serotonergic drugs causally induce the same topographic change in temporal autocorrelation.

            Accumulating evidence suggests that, during task performance, information is encoded at shorter timescales in primary sensory regions as compared to longer timescales in higher-order cortical regions. These encoding timescales correlate with the timescales of activity within these regions. Here, we test the hypothesis that a hierarchy of activity timescales represents a general organizing principle of brain function. Using functional imaging of the human brain in the eyes-open resting state, we find that the timescales of ongoing activity are hierarchically organized as gradients across the entire cerebral cortex. Further, whole-brain coverage permitted examination of subcortical structures, which exhibited hierarchical timescale gradients parallel to cerebral cortex. Altogether, our results support the existence of hierarchical gradients that globally organize human brain dynamics.
          , 
            Multimodal evidence suggests that brain regions accumulate information over timescales that vary according to anatomical hierarchy. Thus, these experimentally defined “temporal receptive windows” are longest in cortical regions that are distant from sensory input. Interestingly, spontaneous activity in these regions also plays out over relatively slow timescales (i.e., exhibits slower temporal autocorrelation decay). These findings raise the possibility that hierarchical timescales represent an intrinsic organizing principle of brain function. Here, using resting-state functional {MRI}, we show that the timescale of ongoing dynamics follows hierarchical spatial gradients throughout human cerebral cortex. These intrinsic timescale gradients give rise to systematic frequency differences among large-scale cortical networks and predict individual-specific features of functional connectivity. Whole-brain coverage permitted us to further investigate the large-scale organization of subcortical dynamics. We show that cortical timescale gradients are topographically mirrored in striatum, thalamus, and cerebellum. Finally, timescales in the hippocampus followed a posterior-to-anterior gradient, corresponding to the longitudinal axis of increasing representational scale. Thus, hierarchical dynamics emerge as a global organizing principle of mammalian brains.},

These gradients reflect spatial patterns of gene expression, intracortical myelin and cortical thickness, as well as structural and functional network embedding. Importantly, these gradients are correlated with patterns of meta-analytic functional activation, differentiating cognitive versus affective processing and sensory versus higher-order cognitive processing.

Using resting-state {fMRI} and diffusion {MRI} data from 100 healthy individuals from the Human Connectome Project, here we show that the timescale of resting-state {fMRI} dynamics increases with structural connectivity strength, matching recent results in the mouse brain. Our results hold at the level of individuals, are robust to parcellation schemes, and are conserved across a range of different timescalerelated statistics. We establish a comprehensive {BOLD} dynamical signature of structural connectivity strength by comparing over 6,000 time series features, highlighting a range of new temporal features for characterizing {BOLD} dynamics, including measures of stationarity and symbolic motif frequencies.

This “correspondence problem” affects, for example, the interpretation of comparisons between task-based patterns of functional activation, resting-state networks or modules, and neuroanatomical landmarks. To date, this problem has been addressed with remarkable variability in terms of methodological approaches and statistical rigor. In this paper, we address the correspondence problem using a spatial permutation framework to generate null models of overlap by applying random rotations to spherical representations of the cortical surface, an approach for which we also provide a theoretical statistical foundation. We use this method to derive clusters of cognitive functions that are correlated in terms of their functional neuroatomical substrates. In addition, using publicly available data, we formally demonstrate the correspondence between maps of task-based functional activity, resting-state {fMRI} networks and gyral-based anatomical landmarks. We provide open-access code to implement the methods presented for two commonly-used tools for surface based cortical analysis (https://www.github.com/spin-test).

Here we show that this standard procedure often fails to recover the correct timescales due to a statistical bias arising from the finite sample size. We develop an alternative approach to estimate timescales by fitting the sample autocorrelation or power spectrum with a generative model based on a mixture of Ornstein–Uhlenbeck processes using adaptive approximate Bayesian computations. Our method accounts for finite sample size and noise in data and returns a posterior distribution of timescales that quantifies the estimation uncertainty and can be used for model selection. We demonstrate the accuracy of our method on synthetic data and illustrate its application to recordings from the primate cortex.

          Recent years have seen growing interest in characterizing the properties of regional brain dynamics and their relationship to other features of brain structure and function. In particular, multiple studies have observed regional differences in the “timescale” over which activity fluctuates during periods of quiet rest. In the cerebral cortex, these timescales have been associated with both local circuit properties as well as patterns of inter-regional connectivity, including the extent to which each region exhibits widespread connectivity to other brain areas. In the current study, we build on prior observations of an association between connectivity and dynamics in the cerebral cortex by investigating the relationship between {BOLD} {fMRI} timescales and the modular organization of structural and functional brain networks. We characterize network community structure across multiple scales and find that longer timescales are associated with greater within-community functional connectivity and diverse structural connectivity. We also replicate prior observations of a positive correlation between timescales and structural connectivity degree. Finally, we find evidence for preferential functional connectivity between cortical areas with similar timescales. We replicate these findings in an independent dataset. These results contribute to our understanding of functional brain organization and structure-function relationships in the human brain, and support the notion that regional differences in cortical dynamics may in part reflect the topological role of each region within macroscale brain networks.},

Thus, pairwise correlations (zero-lag functional connectivity ({FC})) and temporal delays among regional {rsfMRI} signals provide useful, complementary descriptions of spatiotemporal structure in infra-slow activity. However, the slow nature of {fMRI} signals implies that practical scan durations cannot provide sufﬁcient independent temporal samples to stabilize either of these measures. Here, we examine factors affecting sampling variability in both time delay estimation ({TDE}) and {FC}. Although both {TDE} and {FC} accuracy are highly sensitive to data quantity, we use surrogate {fMRI} time series to study how the former is additionally related to the magnitude of a given pairwise correlation and, to a lesser extent, the temporal sampling rate. These contingencies are further explored in real data comprising 30-min {rsfMRI} scans, where sampling error (i.e., limited accuracy owing to insufﬁcient data quantity) emerges as a signiﬁcant but underappreciated challenge to {FC} and, even more so, to {TDE}. Exclusion of high-motion epochs exacerbates sampling error; thus, both sides of the bias-variance (or data quality-quantity) tradeoff associated with data exclusion should be considered when analyzing {rsfMRI} data. Finally, we present strategies for {TDE} in motion-corrupted data, for characterizing sampling error in {TDE} and {FC}, and for mitigating the inﬂuence of sampling error on lag-based analyses.},

These scale-free brain dynamics contain complex spatiotemporal structures and are modulated by task performance. Here we show that the {fMRI} signal recorded from the human brain is also scale free; its power-law exponent differentiates between brain networks and correlates with {fMRI} signal variance and brain glucose metabolism. Importantly, in parallel to brain electrical field potentials, the variance and power-law exponent of the {fMRI} signal decrease during task activation, suggesting that the signal contains more long-range memory during rest and conversely is more efficient at online information processing during task. Remarkably, similar changes also occurred in task-deactivated brain regions, revealing the presence of an optimal dynamic range in the {fMRI} signal. The scale-free properties of the {fMRI} signal and brain electrical field potentials bespeak their respective stationarity and nonstationarity. This suggests that neurovascular coupling mechanism is likely to contain a transformation from nonstationarity to stationarity.

              An {MRI} time course of 512 echo‐planar images ({EPI}) in resting human brain obtained every 250 ms reveals fluctuations in signal intensity in each pixel that have a physiologic origin. Regions of the sensorimotor cortex that were activated secondary to hand movement were identified using functional {MRI} methodology ({FMRI}). Time courses of low frequency ({\textless}0.1 Hz) fluctuations in resting brain were observed to have a high degree of temporal correlation (

              {\textless} 10

              ) within these regions and also with time courses in several other regions that can be associated with motor function. It is concluded that correlation of low frequency fluctuations, which may arise from fluctuations in blood oxygenation or flow, is a manifestation of functional connectivity of the brain.},

Are neuronal oscillations an inevitable by-product, similar to bridge vibrations, or an essential part of the brain's design? Mammalian cortical neurons form behavior-dependent oscillating networks of various sizes, which span five orders of magnitude in frequency. These oscillations are phylogenetically preserved, suggesting that they are functionally relevant. Recent findings indicate that network oscillations bias input selection, temporally link neurons into assemblies, and facilitate synaptic plasticity, mechanisms that cooperatively support temporal representation and long-term consolidation of information.},

	abstract = {Scale-free dynamics, with a power spectrum following P f f Àb, are an intrinsic feature of many complex processes in nature. In neural systems, scale-free activity is often neglected in electrophysiological research. Here, we investigate scale-free dynamics in human brain and show that it contains extensive nested frequencies, with the phase of lower frequencies modulating the amplitude of higher frequencies in an upward progression across the frequency spectrum. The functional signiﬁcance of scale-free brain activity is indicated by task performance modulation and regional variation, with b being larger in default network and visual cortex and smaller in hippocampus and cerebellum. The precise patterns of nested frequencies in the brain differ from other scale-free dynamics in nature, such as earth seismic waves and stock market ﬂuctuations, suggesting system-speciﬁc generative mechanisms. Our ﬁndings reveal robust temporal structures and behavioral signiﬁcance of scale-free brain activity and should motivate future study on its physiological mechanisms and cognitive implications.},

	abstract = {Real-world events unfold at different time scales and, therefore, cognitive and neuronal processes must likewise occur at different time scales. We present a novel procedure that identifies brain regions responsive to sensory information accumulated over different time scales. We measured functional magnetic resonance imaging activity while observers viewed silent films presented forward, backward, or piecewise-scrambled in time. Early visual areas (e.g., primary visual cortex and the motion-sensitive area {MT}+) exhibited high response reliability regardless of disruptions in temporal structure. In contrast, the reliability of responses in several higher brain areas, including the superior temporal sulcus ({STS}), precuneus, posterior lateral sulcus ({LS}), temporal parietal junction ({TPJ}), and frontal eye field ({FEF}), was affected by information accumulated over longer time scales. These regions showed highly reproducible responses for repeated forward, but not for backward or piecewise-scrambled presentations. Moreover, these regions exhibited marked differences in temporal characteristics, with {LS}, {TPJ}, and {FEF} responses depending on information accumulated over longer durations (∼36 s) than {STS} and precuneus (∼12 s). We conclude that, similar to the known cortical hierarchy of spatial receptive fields, there is a hierarchy of progressively longer temporal receptive windows in the human brain.},

Substantial effort has been devoted to understanding the many potential mechanisms that may underlie memory-associated persistent activity. These rely either on the intrinsic properties of individual neurons or on the connectivity within neural circuits to maintain the persistent activity. Nevertheless, it remains unclear which mechanisms are at play in the many brain areas involved in working memory. Herein, we ﬁrst summarize the palette of different mechanisms that can generate persistent activity. We then discuss recent work that asks which mechanisms underlie persistent activity in different brain areas. Finally, we discuss future studies that might tackle this question further. Our goal is to bridge between the communities of researchers who study either single-neuron biophysical, or neural circuit, mechanisms that can generate the persistent activity that underlies working memory.},
