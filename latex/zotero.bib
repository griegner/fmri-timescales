            In the neocortex, while early sensory areas encode and process external inputs rapidly, higher-association areas are endowed with slow dynamics suitable for accumulating information over time. Such a hierarchy of temporal response windows along the cortical hierarchy naturally emerges in a model of multiareal primate cortex. This finding raises the question of why diverse temporal modes are not mixed in roughly the same way across the whole cortex, despite high connection density and an abundance of feedback loops. We investigate this question by mathematically analyzing the anatomically based network model of macaque cortex and theoretically show that three sufficient conditions of synaptic excitation and inhibition give rise to timescale segregation in a hierarchy, a functionally important characteristic of the cortex.
          , 
            A cardinal feature of the neocortex is the progressive increase of the spatial receptive fields along the cortical hierarchy. Recently, theoretical and experimental findings have shown that the temporal response windows also gradually enlarge, so that early sensory neural circuits operate on short timescales whereas higher-association areas are capable of integrating information over a long period of time. While an increased receptive field is accounted for by spatial summation of inputs from neurons in an upstream area, the emergence of timescale hierarchy cannot be readily explained, especially given the dense interareal cortical connectivity known in the modern connectome. To uncover the required neurobiological properties, we carried out a rigorous analysis of an anatomically based large-scale cortex model of macaque monkeys. Using a perturbation method, we show that the segregation of disparate timescales is defined in terms of the localization of eigenvectors of the connectivity matrix, which depends on three circuit properties: 1) a macroscopic gradient of synaptic excitation, 2) distinct electrophysiological properties between excitatory and inhibitory neuronal populations, and 3) a detailed balance between long-range excitatory inputs and local inhibitory inputs for each area-to-area pathway. Our work thus provides a quantitative understanding of the mechanism underlying the emergence of timescale hierarchy in large-scale primate cortical networks.},

The timescale gradient is observed through the unsupervised clustering of the power spectra of individual brains, both in the presence and absence of a stimulus, and is enhanced in the stimulus-locked component that is shared across listeners. Moreover, intrinsically faster dynamics occur in areas that respond preferentially to momentary stimulus features, while the intrinsically slower dynamics occur in areas that integrate stimulus information over longer timescales.

            The human cortex exhibits intrinsic neural timescales that shape a temporal hierarchy. Whether this temporal hierarchy follows the spatial hierarchy of its topography, namely the core-periphery organization, remains an open issue. Using magnetoencephalography data, we investigate intrinsic neural timescales during rest and task states; we measure the autocorrelation window in short ({ACW}-50) and, introducing a novel variant, long ({ACW}-0) windows. We demonstrate longer {ACW}-50 and {ACW}-0 in networks located at the core compared to those at the periphery with rest and task states showing a high {ACW} correlation. Calculating rest-task differences, i.e., subtracting the shared core-periphery organization, reveals task-specific {ACW} changes in distinct networks. Finally, employing kernel density estimation, machine learning, and simulation, we demonstrate that {ACW}-0 exhibits better prediction in classifying a region’s time window as core or periphery. Overall, our findings provide fundamental insight into how the human cortex’s temporal hierarchy converges with its spatial core-periphery hierarchy.},

We deﬁned the intrinsic timescale as the decay constant of the autocorrelation structure computed during a baseline period of the task. We found that neurons with longer intrinsic timescale tended to maintain a stronger spatial response coding during a delay period. This result suggests that longer intrinsic timescales predict the functional role of {PMd} neurons in a cognitive task. Our estimate of the intrinsic timescale integrates an existing hierarchical model (Murray et al., 2014), by assigning to {PMd} a lower position than prefrontal cortex in the hierarchical ordering of the brain areas based on neurons’ timescales.},

On one hand, sensory areas exhibit fast dynamics often phase-locked to stimulation; on the other hand, frontal lobe areas with slow response latencies to stimuli must integrate and maintain information for longer periods. Thus, cortical areas may require different timescales depending on their functional role. Studying the cortical somatosensory network while monkeys discriminated between two vibrotactile stimulus patterns, we found that a hierarchical order could be established across cortical areas based on their intrinsic timescales. Further, even though subareas (areas 3b, 1, and 2) of the primary somatosensory (S1) cortex exhibit analogous firing rate responses, a clear differentiation was observed in their timescales. Importantly, we observed that this inherent timescale hierarchy was invariant between task contexts (demanding vs. nondemanding). Even if task context severely affected neural coding in cortical areas downstream to S1, their timescales remained unaffected. Moreover, we found that these time constants were invariant across neurons with different latencies or coding. Although neurons had completely different dynamics, they all exhibited comparable timescales within each cortical area. Our results suggest that this measure is demonstrative of an inherent characteristic of each cortical area, is not a dynamical feature of individual neurons, and does not depend on task demands.},

            Recent studies have shown that temporal stability of the neuronal activity over time can be estimated by the structure of the spike-count autocorrelation of neuronal populations. This estimation, called the intrinsic timescale, has been computed for several cortical areas and can be used to propose a cortical hierarchy reflecting a scale of temporal receptive windows between areas. In this study, we performed an autocorrelation analysis on neuronal populations of three basal ganglia ({BG}) nuclei, including the striatum and the subthalamic nucleus ({STN}), the input structures of the {BG}, and the external globus pallidus ({GPe}). The analysis was performed during the baseline period of a motivational visuomotor task in which monkeys had to apply different amounts of force to receive different amounts of reward. We found that the striatum and the {STN} have longer intrinsic timescales than the {GPe}. Moreover, our results allow for the placement of these subcortical structures within the already-defined scale of cortical temporal receptive windows. Estimates of intrinsic timescales are important in adding further constraints in the development of computational models of the complex dynamics among these nuclei and throughout cortico-{BG}-thalamo-cortical loops.},

All four regions encode economic variables in similar proportions and show similar putative signatures of key choice-related computations. We provide evidence to support a gradient of function that proceeds from areas 14 to 25 to 32 to 24. Specifically, we show that decodability of twelve distinct task variables increases along that path, consistent with the idea that regions that are higher in the anatomical hierarchy make choice-relevant variables more separable. We also show progressively longer intrinsic timescales in the same series. Together these results highlight the importance of the medial wall in choice, endorse a specific gradient-based organization, and argue against a modular functional neuroanatomy of choice.},

	abstract = {How long neural information is stored in a local brain area reflects functions of that region and is often estimated by the magnitude of the autocorrelation of intrinsic neural signals in the area. Here, we investigated such intrinsic neural timescales in high-functioning adults with autism and examined whether local brain dynamics reflected their atypical behaviours. By analysing resting-state {fMRI} data, we identified shorter neural timescales in the sensory/visual cortices and a longer timescale in the right caudate in autism. The shorter intrinsic timescales in the sensory/visual areas were correlated with the severity of autism, whereas the longer timescale in the caudate was associated with cognitive rigidity. These observations were confirmed from neurodevelopmental perspectives and replicated in two independent cross-sectional datasets. Moreover, the intrinsic timescale was correlated with local grey matter volume. This study shows that functional and structural atypicality in local brain areas is linked to higher-order cognitive symptoms in autism.
          , 
            Autism is a brain disorder that affects how people interact with others. It occupies a spectrum, with severe autism at one end and high-functioning autism at the other. People with severe autism usually have intellectual impairments and little spoken language. Those with high-functioning autism have average or above average {IQ}, but struggle with more subtle aspects of communication, such as body language. As well as social difficulties, many individuals with autism show repetitive behaviors and have narrow interests.
            The brains of people with autism process information differently to those of people without autism. The brain as a whole shows less coordinated activity in autism, for example. But whether individual brain regions themselves also work differently in autism is unclear. Watanabe et al. set out to answer this question by using a brain scanner to compare the resting brain activity of high-functioning people with autism to that of people without autism.
            In both groups, networks of brain regions increased and decreased their activity in predictable patterns. But in individuals with autism, sensory areas of the brain showed more random activity than in individuals without autism. The most random activity occurred in those with the most severe autism. This suggests that the brains of people with autism cannot hold onto and process sensory input for as long as those of neurotypical people. By contrast, a brain region called the caudate showed the opposite pattern, being more predictable in individuals with autism. The most predictable caudate activity occurred in those individuals with the most inflexible, repetitive behaviors. These differences in this neural randomness appear to result from changes in the structure of the individual brain regions.
            The findings of Watanabe et al. suggest that changes in the structure and activity of small brain regions give rise to complex symptoms in autism. If these differences also exist in young children, they could help doctors diagnose autism earlier. Future studies should investigate whether the differences in brain activity cause the symptoms of autism. If so, it may be possible to treat the symptoms by changing brain activity, for example, by applying magnetic stimulation to the scalp.},

            Sleep is crucial for daytime functioning, cognitive performance and general well-being. These aspects of daily life are known to be impaired after extended wake, yet, the underlying neuronal correlates have been difficult to identify. Accumulating evidence suggests that normal functioning of the brain is characterized by long-range temporal correlations ({LRTCs}) in cortex, which are supportive for decision-making and working memory tasks. Here we assess {LRTCs} in resting state human {EEG} data during a 40-hour sleep deprivation experiment by evaluating the decay in autocorrelation and the scaling exponent of the detrended fluctuation analysis from {EEG} amplitude fluctuations. We find with both measures that {LRTCs} decline as sleep deprivation progresses. This decline becomes evident when taking changes in signal power into appropriate consideration. In contrast, the presence of strong signal power increases in some frequency bands over the course of sleep deprivation may falsely indicate {LRTC} changes that do not reflect the underlying long-range temporal correlation structure. Our results demonstrate the importance of sleep to maintain {LRTCs} in the human brain. In complex networks, {LRTCs} naturally emerge in the vicinity of a critical state. The observation of declining {LRTCs} during wake thus provides additional support for our hypothesis that sleep reorganizes cortical networks towards critical dynamics for optimal functioning.},

	abstract = {Environmental events are processed on multiple timescales via hierarchical organization of temporal receptive windows ({TRWs}) in the brain. The dependence of neural timescales and {TRWs} on altered states of consciousness is unclear. States of reduced consciousness are marked by a shift toward slowing of neural dynamics ({\textless}1 Hz) in {EEG}/{ECoG} signals. We hypothesize that such prolongation of intrinsic timescales are also seen in blood-oxygen-level-dependent ({BOLD}) signals. To test this hypothesis, we measured the timescales of intrinsic {BOLD} signals using mean frequency ({MF}) and temporal autocorrelation ({AC}) in healthy volunteers (
              n
              = 23; male/female 14/9) during graded sedation with propofol. We further examined the relationship between the intrinsic timescales (local/voxel level) and its regional connectivity (across neighboring voxels; regional homogeneity, {ReHo}), global (whole-brain level) functional connectivity ({GFC}), and topographical similarity (Topo). Additional results were obtained from patients undergoing deep general anesthesia (
              n
              = 12; male/female: 5/7) and in patients with disorders of consciousness ({DOC}) (
              n
              = 21; male/female: 14/7). We found that {MF}, {AC}, and {ReHo} increased, whereas {GFC} and Topo decreased, during propofol sedation. The local alterations occur before changes of distant connectivity. Conversely, all of these parameters decreased in deep anesthesia and in patients with {DOC}. We conclude that propofol synchronizes local neuronal interactions and prolongs the timescales of intrinsic {BOLD} signals. These effects may impede communication among distant brain regions. Furthermore, the intrinsic timescales exhibit distinct dynamic signatures in sedation, deep anesthesia, and {DOC}. These results improve our understanding of the neural mechanisms of unconsciousness in pharmacologic and neuropathologic states.
            
            
              {SIGNIFICANCE} {STATEMENT}
              Information processing in the brain occurs through a hierarchy of temporal receptive windows ({TRWs}) in multiple timescales. Anesthetic drugs induce a reversible suppression of consciousness and thus offer a unique opportunity to investigate the state dependence of neural timescales. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that sedation with propofol is accompanied by the prolongation of the timescales of intrinsic {BOLD} signals presumably reflecting enlarged {TRWs}. We show that this is accomplished by an increase of local and regional signal synchronization, effects that may disrupt information exchange among distant brain regions. Furthermore, we show that the timescales of intrinsic {BOLD} signals exhibit distinct dynamic signatures in sedation, deep anesthesia, and disorders of consciousness.},

To explore this question, we examined the latency structure of spontaneous fluctuations in the {fMRI} {BOLD} signal. Our data reveal that intrinsic activity propagates through and across networks on a timescale of ∼1 s. Variations in the latency structure of this activity resulting from sensory state manipulation (eyes open vs. closed), antecedent motor task (button press) performance, and time of day (morning vs. evening) suggest that {BOLD} signal lags reflect neuronal processes rather than hemodynamic delay.

Nevertheless, it remains unclear which mechanisms are at play in the many brain areas involved in working memory. Herein, we ﬁrst summarize the palette of different mechanisms that can generate persistent activity. We then discuss recent work that asks which mechanisms underlie persistent activity in different brain areas. Finally, we discuss future studies that might tackle this question further.

We present a novel procedure that identifies brain regions responsive to sensory information accumulated over different time scales. We measured functional magnetic resonance imaging activity while observers viewed silent films presented forward, backward, or piecewise-scrambled in time. Early visual areas (e.g., primary visual cortex and the motion-sensitive area {MT}+) exhibited high response reliability regardless of disruptions in temporal structure. In contrast, the reliability of responses in several higher brain areas, including the superior temporal sulcus ({STS}), precuneus, posterior lateral sulcus ({LS}), temporal parietal junction ({TPJ}), and frontal eye field ({FEF}), was affected by information accumulated over longer time scales. These regions showed highly reproducible responses for repeated forward, but not for backward or piecewise-scrambled presentations. Moreover, these regions exhibited marked differences in temporal characteristics, with {LS}, {TPJ}, and {FEF} responses depending on information accumulated over longer durations (∼36 s) than {STS} and precuneus (∼12 s). We conclude that, similar to the known cortical hierarchy of spatial receptive fields, there is a hierarchy of progressively longer temporal receptive windows in the human brain.},

Here we show that the {fMRI} signal recorded from the human brain is also scale free; its power-law exponent differentiates between brain networks and correlates with {fMRI} signal variance and brain glucose metabolism. Importantly, in parallel to brain electrical field potentials, the variance and power-law exponent of the {fMRI} signal decrease during task activation, suggesting that the signal contains more long-range memory during rest and conversely is more efficient at online information processing during task. Remarkably, similar changes also occurred in task-deactivated brain regions, revealing the presence of an optimal dynamic range in the {fMRI} signal. The scale-free properties of the {fMRI} signal and brain electrical field potentials bespeak their respective stationarity and nonstationarity. This suggests that neurovascular coupling mechanism is likely to contain a transformation from nonstationarity to stationarity.

In particular, multiple studies have observed regional differences in the “timescale” over which activity fluctuates during periods of quiet rest. In the cerebral cortex, these timescales have been associated with both local circuit properties as well as patterns of inter-regional connectivity, including the extent to which each region exhibits widespread connectivity to other brain areas. In the current study, we build on prior observations of an association between connectivity and dynamics in the cerebral cortex by investigating the relationship between {BOLD} {fMRI} timescales and the modular organization of structural and functional brain networks. We characterize network community structure across multiple scales and find that longer timescales are associated with greater within-community functional connectivity and diverse structural connectivity. We also replicate prior observations of a positive correlation between timescales and structural connectivity degree. Finally, we find evidence for preferential functional connectivity between cortical areas with similar timescales. We replicate these findings in an independent dataset. These results contribute to our understanding of functional brain organization and structure-function relationships in the human brain, and support the notion that regional differences in cortical dynamics may in part reflect the topological role of each region within macroscale brain networks.},

Thus, pairwise correlations (zero-lag functional connectivity ({FC})) and temporal delays among regional {rsfMRI} signals provide useful, complementary descriptions of spatiotemporal structure in infra-slow activity. However, the slow nature of {fMRI} signals implies that practical scan durations cannot provide sufﬁcient independent temporal samples to stabilize either of these measures. Here, we examine factors affecting sampling variability in both time delay estimation ({TDE}) and {FC}. Although both {TDE} and {FC} accuracy are highly sensitive to data quantity, we use surrogate {fMRI} time series to study how the former is additionally related to the magnitude of a given pairwise correlation and, to a lesser extent, the temporal sampling rate. These contingencies are further explored in real data comprising 30-min {rsfMRI} scans, where sampling error (i.e., limited accuracy owing to insufﬁcient data quantity) emerges as a signiﬁcant but underappreciated challenge to {FC} and, even more so, to {TDE}. Exclusion of high-motion epochs exacerbates sampling error; thus, both sides of the bias-variance (or data quality-quantity) tradeoff associated with data exclusion should be considered when analyzing {rsfMRI} data. Finally, we present strategies for {TDE} in motion-corrupted data, for characterizing sampling error in {TDE} and {FC}, and for mitigating the inﬂuence of sampling error on lag-based analyses.},

            Timescales characterize the pace of change for many dynamic processes in nature. They are usually estimated by fitting the exponential decay of data autocorrelation in the time or frequency domain. Here we show that this standard procedure often fails to recover the correct timescales due to a statistical bias arising from the finite sample size. We develop an alternative approach to estimate timescales by fitting the sample autocorrelation or power spectrum with a generative model based on a mixture of Ornstein–Uhlenbeck processes using adaptive approximate Bayesian computations. Our method accounts for finite sample size and noise in data and returns a posterior distribution of timescales that quantifies the estimation uncertainty and can be used for model selection. We demonstrate the accuracy of our method on synthetic data and illustrate its application to recordings from the primate cortex. We provide a customizable Python package that implements our framework via different generative models suitable for diverse applications.},

The organization of timescales is associated with cognitive function, distinctive between individuals, and disrupted in disease, but we do not yet understand how the temporal properties of activity dynamics are shaped by the brain’s underlying structural connectivity network. Using resting-state {fMRI} and diffusion {MRI} data from 100 healthy individuals from the Human Connectome Project, here we show that the timescale of resting-state {fMRI} dynamics increases with structural connectivity strength, matching recent results in the mouse brain. Our results hold at the level of individuals, are robust to parcellation schemes, and are conserved across a range of different timescalerelated statistics. We establish a comprehensive {BOLD} dynamical signature of structural connectivity strength by comparing over 6,000 time series features, highlighting a range of new temporal features for characterizing {BOLD} dynamics, including measures of stationarity and symbolic motif frequencies.

These gradients reflect spatial patterns of gene expression, intracortical myelin and cortical thickness, as well as structural and functional network embedding.

            Accumulating evidence suggests that, during task performance, information is encoded at shorter timescales in primary sensory regions as compared to longer timescales in higher-order cortical regions. These encoding timescales correlate with the timescales of activity within these regions. Here, we test the hypothesis that a hierarchy of activity timescales represents a general organizing principle of brain function. Using functional imaging of the human brain in the eyes-open resting state, we find that the timescales of ongoing activity are hierarchically organized as gradients across the entire cerebral cortex. Further, whole-brain coverage permitted examination of subcortical structures, which exhibited hierarchical timescale gradients parallel to cerebral cortex. Altogether, our results support the existence of hierarchical gradients that globally organize human brain dynamics.
          , 
            Multimodal evidence suggests that brain regions accumulate information over timescales that vary according to anatomical hierarchy. Thus, these experimentally defined “temporal receptive windows” are longest in cortical regions that are distant from sensory input. Interestingly, spontaneous activity in these regions also plays out over relatively slow timescales (i.e., exhibits slower temporal autocorrelation decay). These findings raise the possibility that hierarchical timescales represent an intrinsic organizing principle of brain function. Here, using resting-state functional {MRI}, we show that the timescale of ongoing dynamics follows hierarchical spatial gradients throughout human cerebral cortex. These intrinsic timescale gradients give rise to systematic frequency differences among large-scale cortical networks and predict individual-specific features of functional connectivity. Whole-brain coverage permitted us to further investigate the large-scale organization of subcortical dynamics. We show that cortical timescale gradients are topographically mirrored in striatum, thalamus, and cerebellum. Finally, timescales in the hippocampus followed a posterior-to-anterior gradient, corresponding to the longitudinal axis of increasing representational scale. Thus, hierarchical dynamics emerge as a global organizing principle of mammalian brains.},

Here we show that spatial and temporal autocorrelation are reliable statistics that explain numerous measures of network topology. Surrogate time series with subject-matched spatial and temporal autocorrelation capture nearly all reliable individual and regional variation in these topology measures. Network topology changes during aging are driven by spatial autocorrelation, and multiple serotonergic drugs causally induce the same topographic change in temporal autocorrelation.

Here, we infer neuronal timescales from invasive intracranial recordings. Timescales increase along the principal sensorimotor-to-association axis across the entire human cortex, and scale with single-unit timescales within macaques. Cortex-wide transcriptomic analysis shows direct alignment between timescales and expression of excitation- and inhibition-related genes, as well as genes specific to voltage-gated transmembrane ion transporters. Finally, neuronal timescales are functionally dynamic: prefrontal cortex timescales expand during working memory maintenance and predict individual performance, while cortex-wide timescales compress with aging. Thus, neuronal timescales follow cytoarchitectonic gradients across the human cortex and are relevant for cognition in both short and long terms, bridging microcircuit physiology with macroscale dynamics and behavior.},

However, if the time series are themselves dependent (i.e. exhibit temporal autocorrelation), the effective degrees of freedom ({EDF}) are reduced, the standard error of the sample correlation coefﬁcient is biased, and Fisher's transformation fails to stabilise the variance. Since {fMRI} time series are notoriously autocorrelated, the issue of biased standard errors – before or after Fisher's transformation – becomes vital in individual-level analysis of resting-state functional connectivity ({rsFC}) and must be addressed anytime a standardised Z-score is computed. We ﬁnd that the severity of autocorrelation is highly dependent on spatial characteristics of brain regions, such as the size of regions of interest and the spatial location of those regions. We further show that the available {EDF} estimators make restrictive assumptions that are not supported by the data, resulting in biased {rsFC} inferences that lead to distorted topological descriptions of the connectome on the individual level. We propose a practical “{xDF}” method that accounts not only for distinct autocorrelation in each time series, but instantaneous and lagged crosscorrelation. We ﬁnd the {xDF} correction varies substantially over node pairs, indicating the limitations of global {EDF} corrections used previously. In addition to extensive synthetic and real data validations, we investigate the impact of this correction on {rsFC} measures in data from the Young Adult Human Connectome Project, showing that accounting for autocorrelation dramatically changes fundamental graph theoretical measures relative to no correction.},

These pipelines are specially designed to capitalize on the high quality data offered by the {HCP}.

	abstract = {Many sources of ﬂuctuation contribute to the {fMRI} signal, and this makes identifying the effects that are truly related to the underlying neuronal activity difﬁcult. Independent component analysis ({ICA}) – one of the most widely used techniques for the exploratory analysis of {fMRI} data – has shown to be a powerful technique in identifying various sources of neuronally-related and artefactual ﬂuctuation in {fMRI} data (both with the application of external stimuli and with the subject “at rest”). {ICA} decomposes {fMRI} data into patterns of activity (a set of spatial maps and their corresponding time series) that are statistically independent and add linearly to explain voxelwise time series. Given the set of {ICA} components, if the components representing “signal” (brain activity) can be distinguished form the “noise” components (effects of motion, non-neuronal physiology, scanner artefacts and other nuisance sources), the latter can then be removed from the data, providing an effective cleanup of structured noise. Manual classiﬁcation of components is labour intensive and requires expertise; hence, a fully automatic noise detection algorithm that can reliably detect various types of noise sources (in both task and resting {fMRI}) is desirable. In this paper, we introduce {FIX} (“{FMRIB}'s {ICA}-based X-noiseiﬁer”), which provides an automatic solution for denoising {fMRI} data via accurate classiﬁcation of {ICA} components. For each {ICA} component {FIX} generates a large number of distinct spatial and temporal features, each describing a different aspect of the data (e.g., what proportion of temporal ﬂuctuations are at high frequencies). The set of features is then fed into a multi-level classiﬁer (built around several different classiﬁers). Once trained through the handclassiﬁcation of a sufﬁcient number of training datasets, the classiﬁer can then automatically classify new datasets. The noise components can then be subtracted from (or regressed out of) the original data, to provide automated cleanup. On conventional resting-state {fMRI} ({rfMRI}) single-run datasets, {FIX} achieved about 95\% overall accuracy. On high-quality {rfMRI} data from the Human Connectome Project, {FIX} achieves over 99\% classiﬁcation accuracy, and as a result is being used in the default {rfMRI} processing pipeline for generating {HCP} connectomes. {FIX} is publicly available as a plugin for {FSL}.},
