\title{Estimating fMRI Timescale Maps}

\section*{Abstract}
Timescales describe the rate at which time-dependent processes decay, including activity in neurons, neural populations, and large-scale brain networks. The spatial organization of timescales over the brain offers mechanistic insight into how regions integrate and process information over time. Despite their functional significance, current estimation methods rely on restrictive assumptions and report only point estimates, limiting statistical inference. This paper introduces two robust models for timescale estimation that are evaluated under general assumptions: a time-domain linear model and an autocorrelation-domain nonlinear model. We establish the theoretical properties of these models (bias, consistency, limiting variance), enabling standard errors for point estimates, hypothesis testing, and confidence intervals. Sampling bias and variance are evaluated via simulations. Timescale maps are estimated using resting fMRI from the Human Connectome Project. Comparatively, the linear model is more computationally efficient and scalable to mass-univariate settings like fMRI, while the nonlinear model is more sensitive to long-range temporal dependencies. Both models employ robust standard errors to address biases under model misspecification, improving reliability in simulated and empirical settings. These methods yield cortical timescale maps consistent with known anatomical hierarchies, providing a framework for mapping and inferring neural timescales and enabling reliable comparisons across brain regions, conditions, and individuals.
